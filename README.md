# Pollution of water
It is a website dedicated to water pollution, its causes, and possible solutions.
It is a collaborative effort by three of my friends.
  1. I (Md Mizgan Ali) created the entire website.
  2. Raiyan, who acquired local area information and photographs.
  3. Suprit Sagar, who created the website's material.
